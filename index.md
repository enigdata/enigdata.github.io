# About 

I am a senior data scientist with 5+ years of experience in applied machine learning and AI system development. I am passionate about the latest progress of deep learning applied in recommender systems, natural language processing and computer vision.  This site is a collection of my deep learning projects and posts to summarize the lessons learned.  Feel free to reach out with feedback or if you need help!
